1. Feature importance numbers 50-100 f1
2. outliers probably can increase 0.01?
3. Features contain times series, 1-20 days and basic features, how to incorporate these into the time series model
4. NN model tuning
5. Full dataset running without dropping out missing rate > 95% columns
6. 


2 relu layers not superior


Priorities:
1. Neural Network
	a. Prepare config for GPU running 
	b. Set up scripts for different model testing using pytorch, including parameters, layers, activation functions. we need table output for documentation
	c. 

2. False Negatives
	b. predict multi-y


3. Feature engineering
	a. Missing values - fill na with mean
	b. Columns reduction
	c. Time series variables engineering
	d. derivative statistics from most important features

4. Model assembling
	a. use model combination for x
	b.
